# DKM #
## A generic C++11 k-means clustering implementation ##

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/genbattle/dkm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/genbattle/dkm)

This is a k-means clustering algorithm written in C++, intended to be used as a header-only library. Requires C++11.

The algorithm is based on [Lloyds Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd%27s_algorithm) and uses the [kmeans++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means%2B%2B) initialization method.

The library is located in the `include` directory and may be used under the terms of the MIT license (see LICENSE.md). The tests in the `src` directory are also licensed under the MIT license, except for lest.hpp, which has its own license (src/test/LICENSE_1_0.txt), the Boost Software License. The benchmarks located within the `bench` directory also fall under the MIT license. Benchmark data was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris).

A basic benchmark can be found in the bench folder. An example of the current results on an Intel i5-4210U:

```
OpenCV: 1.51998ms
DKM: 0.044276ms
```

This is only running k-means on a small data set (150 samples), and is only a single measurement, so do not interpret the results to mean that DKM is always faster than OpenCV.

### Usage ###

To use the DKM k-means implementation, simply include `include/dkm.hpp` and call `dkm::kmeans_lloyd()` with your data (`std::vector<std::array<>>`) and the number of cluster centers the algorithm should calculate for the data set.

Example:

```cpp
std::vector<std::array<float, 2>> data{{1.f, 1.f}, {2.f, 2.f}, {1200.f, 1200.f}, {2.f, 2.f}};
auto means = dkm::kmeans_lloyd(data, 2);
```

### Building (tests and benchmarks) ###

For tests and benchmarks DKM uses a standard CMake out-of-tree build model.

To make everything:

```console
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. && make
```

To build only the tests run `make dkm_tests` instead of `make`. To build only the benchmarks run `make dkm_bench`.

The tests can be run using the `make test` command or executing `./dkm_tests` in the build directory, and the benchmarks can likewise be run with `./dkm_bench`.


### Compatability ###

The following compilers are officially supported on Linux and tested via [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/genbattle/dkm):

- Clang 3.6
- Clang 3.7
- GCC 4.9
- GCC 5.0+

GCC/Clang versions prior to the above are intentionally unsupported due to poor C++11 support. Other compilers may be considered, Microsoft VC++ is intended to be supported, but does not currently have a CI build set up.

### Dependencies (test) ###

- CMake

### Dependencies (bench) ###

- OpenCV 2.4
- CMake
